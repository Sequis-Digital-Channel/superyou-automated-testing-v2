## Python Selenium
https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/api.html

Steps to implement and execute Automation Test:

1. Install Python:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install all the dependencies required that are listed in requirements.txt
```console
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can check whether the dependices have been installed by running and a list of the installed dependencies will appear
```console
pip list
```
or
```console
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### If you use Google Chrome:

3. Navigate to <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home">Chrome Driver</a> and download the WebDriver that matches the version of your Google Chrome Browser
4. Extract the file from the folder and put it in your C: drive so your PATH would be `C:\chromedriver.exe`
5. Initialize the path by specifying the Driver Path in the .env file. It should look something like this:
`DRIVER_PATH = "C:\chromedriver.exe`
6. Make sure that the webdriver code is `self.driver = webdriver.Chrome(PATH)` instead of `self.driver = webdriver.Edge(PATH)`

#### If you use Microsoft Edge:

3. Ensure that you have Microsoft Edge (Chromium) installed by navigating to `edge://settings/help` and verify that the version number is version 75 or later
4. Navigate to <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/">Microsoft Edge Driver</a> and download the WebDriver that matches the version of your Microsoft Edge
5. Extract the file from the folder and put it in your C: drive so your PATH would be `C:\msedgedriver.exe`
6. Open the repository on your text editor and open your terminal. Enter the following command:
`pip install msedge-selenium-tools selenium==3.141`
7. Initialize the path by specifying the Driver Path in the .env file. It should look something like this:
`DRIVER_PATH = "C:\msedgedriver.exe`
8. Make sure that the webdriver code is `self.driver = webdriver.Edge(PATH)` instead of `self.driver = webdriver.Chrome(PATH)`


A few ways to run automation test:
- Visual Code: Press the Play Button (Top Right Corner)
- Terminal (Windows): Press `python testcase_existing/testcase_existing_single_product.py` then click Enter
- Terminal (Mac): Press `python3 testcase_existing/testcase_existing_single_product.py` then click Enter

## To Run all the Test Cases

All test run scripts is in `testcase_script`

Run in Bash
```console
./test.sh
```
